Are Hedge Fund Activists the True Enforcers of Shareholder Primacy?
Shareholder primacy has been the dominant idea in corporate governance for decades, especially in the US and UK. Rooted in Milton Friedman's assertion that the sole social responsibility of business is to increase profits within the rules of the game, and formalized through agency theory, the doctrine seeks to align managerial behavior with shareholder interests. Yet in practice, dispersed ownership and managerial entrenchment weaken shareholders' ability to discipline management effectively. Against this backdrop, hedge fund activists have emerged as a powerful force. By taking concentrated stakes and aggressively pressuring boards and executives, they increasingly appear to act as de facto enforcers of shareholder primacy.

This essay argues that hedge fund activists are effective enforcers of shareholder primacy, but only in a narrow, financialized sense. They enforce shareholder primacy as understood by financial markets, focused on short-term metrics and capital returns, rather than in a way that reflects the wider purpose of the firm. While such interventions often correct agency failures and unlock shareholder value, they also expose deeper flaws in the shareholder-centric governance model, including short-termism and the fundamental inability of capital markets alone to address systemic challenges like climate change.
1)	Shareholder Primacy and the Governance Gap
-	The idea of shareholder primacy comes from Milton Friedman and agency theory, which was developed by Michael Jensen and William Meckling in 1976. Agency theory is basically about a principal-agent problem. Shareholders (the principals) hire managers (the agents) to run their companies, but there is always a risk that managers will pursue their own interests instead of maximizing value for shareholders. The theory says we need governance mechanisms to make sure managers act in shareholders' interests.
-	However, as the Purpose of Finance course emphasizes, Friedman was actually describing a constrained problem. He said companies should maximize profits, but only "within the rules of the game." These constraints matter a lot. When the rules are too weak to address big problems like climate change or inequality, we have to ask whether shareholder primacy can actually deliver good outcomes for society.
-	In reality, shareholders face a major collective action problem. Think about it this way: if you own just 0.01% of a company, why would you spend your own time and money monitoring management? You would pay all the costs yourself but only get a tiny fraction of any benefits. This is called a free rider problem. Because of this, individual investors lack both the motivation and resources to monitor management properly. The result is that managers can slack off, waste money, and make bad decisions. Boards often become too cozy with management, most shareholders just vote passively without really paying attention, and regulations focus on checking boxes rather than making sure companies are run well. This is the governance gap, and hedge fund activists step right into it.
2)	How Activists Enforce Shareholder Primacy
-	Hedge fund activists differentiate themselves from passive institutional investors by acquiring significant minority stakes (typically 5% to 15%) and deploying public campaigns, proxy contests, and board representation to force strategic changes. Their interventions typically target underperforming firms and focus on capital structure optimization, asset divestitures, cost reductions, or strategic refocusing.
-	From an agency-theoretic perspective, activist hedge funds can be viewed as specialized governance intermediaries. They overcome collective action problems by internalizing the costs and benefits of monitoring. When an activist buys a large stake, they actually have skin in the game and can justify spending millions on research and proxy fights. They provide concentrated oversight that dispersed shareholders cannot. In doing so, they operationalize shareholder primacy far more aggressively than traditional governance mechanisms.
-	This approach differs fundamentally from "universal owners" like sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, and insurers holding diversified portfolios over very long time horizons. Universal owners cannot easily exit their positions (they are too big and hold too much) and understand that "the cost of prevention is generally far lower than the cost of remediation." They have genuine incentives to engage constructively on systemic risks like climate change because these risks affect their entire portfolio. Hedge fund activists, by contrast, typically hold concentrated positions for 2 to 3 years and seek catalysts that will drive near-term returns. This temporal mismatch creates fundamental tension in how they enforce shareholder primacy.
3) Recent Activism: The 2024-2025 Wave
-	The past two years have witnessed record levels of hedge fund activism. In 2024, 243 global campaigns made it the busiest year since 2018. Remarkably, 160 unique activists launched campaigns in 2024, including 45 first-timers, suggesting activism has become increasingly mainstream rather than something only a few specialized funds do.
-	Elliott Management at Southwest Airlines provides a clear example. In June 2024, Elliott disclosed an 11% stake worth $1.9 billion and immediately launched a comprehensive assault on the airline's leadership and business model. Elliott criticized Southwest for being stuck in the past, with the stock down 50% since 2021 while competitors innovated with things like premium seating and fare segmentation.
-	Elliott demanded the removal of both CEO Bob Jordan and Executive Chairman Gary Kelly, nominated eight directors, and called for fundamental changes to Southwest's iconic features like open seating and free bag checks. The campaign even included a podcast series called "Stronger Southwest" featuring interviews with their director nominees, essentially bypassing traditional media to reach shareholders directly.
-	Southwest initially resisted, implementing a poison pill (a defensive measure that makes it expensive for activists to increase their stake). However, by October 2024, facing a special shareholder meeting, Southwest settled. The agreement gave Elliott six board seats, removed Kelly earlier than planned, but preserved Jordan as CEO. Critically, Southwest announced it would abandon open seating for assigned and premium seats, fundamentally altering its 50-year business model.
-	The Southwest campaign reveals several things. First, Elliott enforced a particular vision of shareholder value that prioritized revenue maximization through premium offerings over the company's founding egalitarian ethos. Second, just the threat of a proxy fight proved sufficient to force dramatic strategic shifts. Third, even well-managed companies with loyal customer bases remain vulnerable to activist pressure when short-term financial metrics disappoint.
-	Disney's defeat of Nelson Peltz offers a contrasting case. Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners, holding approximately 1.8% of Disney shares, launched a campaign in 2024 seeking two board seats. Trian's critique focused on sustained underperformance, failed CEO succession planning, and misaligned executive compensation.
-	The proxy fight became "the most expensive in history," with Disney spending an estimated $40 million on its defense. Disney deployed every communications weapon available: social media ads, a dedicated website, surrogate campaigns from people like Jamie Dimon and George Lucas, and direct outreach to retail shareholders.
-	In April 2024, Disney prevailed decisively. Peltz lost by 2 to 1. Critically, Disney secured support from its two largest shareholders, Vanguard and BlackRock, in the final days before voting. Yet the victory was qualified. The director Peltz targeted received only 59% support, the lowest of any Disney director, suggesting his critiques resonated substantially. Moreover, Disney acknowledged the pressure by announcing $3 billion in stock buybacks and board refreshment. So activists can influence corporate behavior even without winning board seats.
-	Starbucks and the CEO replacement demonstrates how activist pressure can force leadership changes. In 2024, both Elliott Management (with a $2 billion stake) and Starboard Value took positions in Starbucks as the chain posted its first same-store sales decline in three years. By August 2024, Starbucks abruptly replaced CEO Laxman Narasimhan with Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol. The stock jumped 20% on the announcement. Notably, 27 CEOs resigned in 2024 at companies targeted by activists, a record high, suggesting growing intolerance for underperformance.
-	These campaigns occurred in an increasingly favorable environment. The Trump administration's return in January 2025 created expectations of reduced regulation and easier M&A. Activists are also increasingly targeting mega-cap companies, which comprised 30% of major activist targets in 2024 versus just 23% five years ago.
4) The Costs of Activist Enforcement
-	The Purpose of Finance course questions whether activist interventions actually create value or just redistribute it. Professor Chris Higson points to research showing that financial intermediation costs have stayed high for over a century. This raises a key question: are activists making things more efficient, or just extracting rents for themselves?
-	When activists generate shareholder value, much of it may come from redistribution rather than real value creation. Cost cuts often hurt employees and long-term investment. Southwest's case shows this clearly. Activists forced the airline to abandon its unique business model. Sure, margins improved and the stock price jumped in the short term, but the company may have destroyed something valuable that made it special in the long run.
-	The 2017 Unilever episode illustrates this tension. Paul Polman, Unilever's CEO, willingly sacrificed short-term profits to invest in brands and sustainability. Yet when Kraft Heinz launched a takeover bid, Polman barely survived. He only defended the company by calling in personal favors from bankers and investors. The course asks pointedly: "Is this a safe environment for purposeful business?" Even when long-term strategies might create real value, companies remain vulnerable to short-term pressure.
5) The ESG Retreat and Why It Matters
-	The past five years reveal something important about how activists enforce shareholder primacy. The ESG movement tried to argue that shareholder value and stakeholder concerns were compatible or even complementary. The idea was that caring about the environment, workers, and society would actually boost long-term profits. But when this promise failed to deliver, it became clear what activists actually enforce: pure shareholder primacy with no real ESG constraints.
-	After the Paris Agreement, governments set ambitious climate targets, companies made bold sustainability promises, and Larry Fink positioned BlackRock as a leader in sustainable investing. The hope was that large institutional investors would voluntarily consider ESG factors when making decisions, creating benefits for both shareholders and society. These big asset managers, with their long time horizons and diversified portfolios, were supposed to be different from short-term hedge fund activists. They were supposed to care about sustainability.
-	But by 2024, this movement had collapsed. BlackRock's support for ESG proposals fell from 47% in 2021 to just 4% by 2024. Vanguard supported zero ESG proposals in 2024. BP abandoned its fossil fuel cuts, Shell slowed its emissions reductions, and Unilever downgraded its sustainability unit. A Texas judge even ruled in January 2025 that American Airlines was "disloyal" to pension members for using BlackRock, which pursued climate goals instead of maximum returns. The message was clear: when ESG conflicts with short-term shareholder returns, shareholder primacy wins.
-	This retreat happened despite eight years since Paris, during which emissions actually kept rising. In fact, 2023 saw more coal burned than any year in history. So much for the win-win narrative.
-	Harvard's Lucien Bebchuk helps explain why this happened. He identifies three different views on how companies should be governed. Friedmanesque Capitalists think profit-focused companies with basic legal rules will produce good outcomes for everyone. Managerial Stakeholderists believe we can trust CEOs to voluntarily balance shareholder interests with stakeholder interests like worker welfare and environmental protection. Democratic Capitalists (Bebchuk's position) argue that only government laws and regulations actually work, because you cannot expect CEOs to reliably serve stakeholders when doing so costs the company money.
-	Bebchuk's research backs up his skepticism. He studied what happens during buyouts and mergers, when real money is on the line and companies have to make concrete decisions. He found that management almost never pursues stakeholder welfare, even at companies that publicly committed to purposeful business and signed things like the Business Roundtable Statement. His conclusion is stark: "stakeholderist talk is mostly for show." When there is real money at stake, shareholder value dominates every time.
-	Hedge fund activists simply make this reality more obvious than other investors. While big asset managers like BlackRock and Vanguard paid lip service to ESG for several years, hedge fund activists never pretended to care about anything beyond shareholder returns. By forcing boards to justify every decision purely in shareholder-value terms, activists expose how weak voluntary ESG commitments really are. When activists like Terry Smith criticize Unilever for being "obsessed with publicly displaying sustainability credentials at the expense of focusing on the fundamentals of the business," they are enforcing shareholder primacy in its purest form, with all the ESG rhetoric stripped away.
-	The ESG retreat proves an important point about activist enforcement: even the supposedly responsible, long-term institutional investors like BlackRock and Vanguard ultimately enforce the same narrow version of shareholder primacy that hedge fund activists do. The only difference is that activists were always honest about it. They never claimed to balance multiple objectives or care about sustainability. They always said shareholder value comes first, period. The collapse of ESG shows they were right about how the system actually works, even if other investors pretended otherwise for a few years. This is why activists are the "true" enforcers—they enforce shareholder primacy without the pretense.
6) Why Market Solutions Cannot Work
-	ESG investing was supposed to work through capital rationing. The idea was simple: if investors refuse to buy shares of polluting companies, those companies face higher costs of capital and will change. But this mechanism has serious problems.
-	First, companies are not very sensitive to their cost of capital. Most firms have plenty of cash and do not make decisions based on slightly higher capital costs. Second, for fossil fuel producers, debt matters more than equity for financing anyway. Third, divesting just transfers ownership to private equity or state-owned companies that face even less pressure. You have not fixed anything, you have just hidden the problem.
-	As the Carbon Majors Report shows, state-owned entities control most fossil fuel production. Saudi Aramco, with no debt and only 5% public ownership, is completely immune to activist pressure. Activists only operate through public equity markets, so they miss most of the climate problem. Focusing on public Western oil companies while ignoring national oil companies makes no sense.
-	This leads to an uncomfortable conclusion: if shareholder primacy is the rule, hedge fund activists may just be the most honest players. They do not pretend you can maximize shareholder value and satisfy all stakeholder claims at the same time. Yet their prominence reflects Professor Higson's concern that finance extracts value without improving social welfare.
-	Bebchuk's Democratic Capitalism offers an alternative. It accepts that markets alone cannot solve systemic problems and argues for government laws and regulations. As Bebchuk says, "it's the government's job." The Montreal Protocol banning CFCs succeeded where climate agreements failed because the science was clear, all nations agreed, and the US government backed it. The OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project shows what governments can achieve when businesses will not voluntarily limit harmful behavior.
7) Conclusion
-	The 2024-2025 campaigns demonstrate that hedge fund activists are indeed enforcing a particular version of shareholder primacy, one focused on near-term metrics, traditional value-maximization strategies, and management accountability measured by quarterly performance. Southwest abandoned its 50-year business model under activist pressure. Starbucks replaced a CEO after disappointing performance in just two quarters. Disney spent $40 million defending against critiques that, while ultimately rejected, still forced strategic concessions.
-	Yet these campaigns also reveal limitations. Disney successfully resisted Peltz by mobilizing retail shareholders and securing support from universal owners like Vanguard and BlackRock. When companies can make credible cases for long-term strategies, activists can be defeated. The Southwest settlement preserved CEO Jordan despite Elliott's demands. And the record 27 CEO resignations in 2024 raise questions about whether this level of executive turnover serves long-term value creation or simply satisfies activist demands for visible change.
-	So are hedge fund activists the true enforcers of shareholder primacy? Yes, but with important qualifications. They frequently impose discipline on entrenched management, address agency failures that boards and dispersed shareholders struggle to resolve, and translate the abstract principles of agency theory into concrete governance outcomes. Their effectiveness is demonstrated by their ability to force strategic pivots, replace underperforming CEOs, and unlock shareholder value that boards failed to deliver.
-	However, their effectiveness is inseparable from the deeper shortcomings of the shareholder-centric model itself. They enforce shareholder primacy efficiently, but not necessarily wisely, often privileging short-term financial performance over long-term investment and broader societal outcomes. Their enforcement is selective, targeting public companies in activist-friendly jurisdictions while missing much of the global economy. They operate within secondary equity markets using mechanisms with limited real-world impact on systemic challenges like climate change.
-	Most fundamentally, the past five years have demonstrated that neither managerial stakeholderism nor investor-driven ESG provides a reliable path to addressing systemic challenges. Bebchuk's critique has been vindicated: corporate leaders retreat from stakeholder commitments when reputational and political incentives shift, and investors abandon engagement when it becomes controversial. The evidence suggests market-based approaches have failed, and green-hushing rather than green-washing now represents the dominant corporate strategy.
-	The path forward requires the tighter constraints Friedman acknowledged: stronger laws, smarter regulations, effective policies, and genuine international cooperation. Activists will continue to enforce shareholder primacy within whatever rules structure we create. The question is whether we will create rules that channel profit-seeking toward socially beneficial ends or continue expecting markets and investors to voluntarily solve problems they are not structured to address. Hedge fund activists often correct managerial agency failures, but their prominence reflects deeper weaknesses in corporate governance and financial markets, rather than a sustainable solution to those problems. If society expects finance to govern the real economy in a way that delivers long-term value creation rather than short-term financial gains, reliance on hedge fund activism alone is unlikely to be sufficient.
